**Ingredients:**3T Butter 2 medium zukes shredded 3 slices Italian bread torn up 1/2 or so Romano cheese (grating of nutmeg, optional) salt and pepper 2 1/2 to 3 lb. broiler, cut in quarters **Instructions:**Melt butter in skillet, add zukes and cook till tender. Remove from heat and add the rest of the stuffing ingredients. Preheat oven to 400. Loosen chicken skin and push stuffing between skin and meat. Use toothpicks to prevent skin from shrinking back and exposing meat. Bake about 50 minutes. 20 minutes before end of cooking, you can add a chopped up onion to tyhe roasting pan and baste with some white wine. I removed the wings after cooking and cut the pieces in half for serving, then sprinkled this with sprigs of fresh oregano on the serving platter.
