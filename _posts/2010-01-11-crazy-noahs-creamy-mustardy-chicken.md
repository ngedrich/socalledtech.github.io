**Ingredients**: 4 chicken breasts, sliced lengthwise into 1/2 inch strips 1 cup flour 1 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper 3 Tbsp butter 3 Tbsp olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced 2/3 cup chicken broth 2/3 cup Marsala 2 cups plain yogurt 2 Tbsp deli mustard **Instructions**: Most important for this recipe is to not use ?Yellow? mustard. By this I don?t mean Asian mustard, which should actually work quite well, but rather the standard fluorescent colored mustard one finds at a baseball park. Look for a mustard that has flecks of actual mustard seed in it. A personal favorite of mine is Kosciusko Spicy Brown Mustard. Start by combining and mixing the flour, salt and pepper in a bowl. Dredge the pieces of chicken in the flour mixture until thoroughly coated. Heat the butter and olive oil in a flat bottomed pan until the butter is melted. Being sure to remove any excess flour, fry the chicken pieces in the butter/oil in batches until the chicken is golden brown on either side. Remove the chicken pieces and drain on a paper towel. Once you have cooked all the chicken pieces, add the garlic and onions to the pan and cook until the onion becomes transluscent. Deglaze the pan with the Marsala and broth and let that mixture cook over high heat until it is reduced in volume by 25%. Lower the heat, and then stir in the yogurt until the sauce is consistent. Finally, Lower the heat, and add in the mustard and chicken pieces. Adding the mustard too early will cause it to lose its flavor and become bitter. Serve over a bed of cous cous.
