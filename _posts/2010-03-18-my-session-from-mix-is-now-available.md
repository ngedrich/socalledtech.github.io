Not sure if anyone cares, but I spoke along with Eric Perez and Sean Scott on the BLITZ collaboration process. We'll be talking more about this on the blitz blog at <http://labs.blitzagency.com>. Please take a look at the video on the mix site [live.visitmix.com](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX10/DS08)
