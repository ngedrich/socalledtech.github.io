**Ingredients:**
- 8 cloves garlic, peeled, and chopped coarse (or 4 Cloves of Elephant Garlic) 
- 2 or more red jalapeno 
- 1/4 cup fresh oregano leaves 
- 1 Bunch fresh parsley leaves 
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
- 1/2 cup olive oil 

**Instructions:**

Roast the jalapeno peppers until black and then peel and remove the stems and seeds. Throw everything into a food processor and then whir it till the party stops. Let sit for a few hours if possible so the flavor has time to get awesome.
